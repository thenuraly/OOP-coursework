INTRODUCTION:
As a topic for my 1st year course-work assignment, I chose the game of tic tac toe. The game is single-player played against the AI. Where the player plays for “X” and goes first, whereas AI plays as “O” and goes second. The AI is very strongly trained, and I am sure that you cannot win it :)

To run the game, PyCharm IDE should be installed to your PC. I used interpreter Python 3.9, which is recommended to use to run this game. Also, libraries such as pygame and time were downloaded, which are also highly recommended in your PC to be downloaded.

Opening the code in the folder, called OOP Project.
